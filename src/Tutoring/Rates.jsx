        My base rate is $15 an hour for anywhere on the MSU campus. Want to negotiate a different rate? <a href="mailto:tutoring@evanlihou.com">Get in touch with me</a> and Iâ€™ll do my best to accomodate. Additionally, if none of the available times listed below work for you, let me know and we can try to schedule for another time.
