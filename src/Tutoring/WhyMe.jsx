          I took CSE 101 last semester as a business-preference major, and since then have switched my major to Computer Science. I earned a 4.0 in CSE 101 when I took it and have a strong understanding of all the concepts taught in the course. If you need help, get it from me and you will come out of our session feeling confident on your homework, quiz prep, or exam prep. From complex Excel formulas to advanced Access functionality to the basics like understanding how the heck binary works, I can help you understand.
        </p>
        <p><b>TL;DR:</b> I got a 4.0 in CSE 101, I can help you do well in it too!</p>
