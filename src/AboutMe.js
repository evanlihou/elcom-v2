        <p>
        I’m just your typical college student and all-around nerd based near Lansing, MI. Below you’ll find some of the things I’ve done recently, as well as a breakdown of what I can do. If you want to get in touch with me professionally, or just say hey, don’t hesitate to click that button and it’ll open a fresh new email. I’m glued to my phone, so you’ll probably even get a quick reply!
