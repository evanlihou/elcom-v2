        <p>
          College junior and all-around nerd based near Lansing, MI. Below you’ll
          find some of the things I’ve done recently, as well as a breakdown of
          what I can do. If you want to get in touch with me professionally, or
          just say hey, don’t hesitate to do so. I’m glued to my phone, so you’ll
          probably get a quick reply.
